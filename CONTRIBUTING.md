## Testing

### Writing Tests

Tests are written using Vitest. Place test files in the `test/` directory.

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { Kengo, defineSchema } from '../src'

describe('Feature Name', () => {
  it('should do something', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const schema = defineSchema({
      version: 1,
      stores: {
        users: {
          '@@id': { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true },
        },
      },
    })

    const db = new Kengo({ name: 'test-db', schema })

    // Act
    const result = await db.users.create({
      data: { name: 'Test' },
    })

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBeDefined()
    expect(result.name).toBe('Test')
  })
})
```

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage. Check coverage with:

```bash
bun test:coverage
```

## Style Guide

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Enable strict mode
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for objects
- Use meaningful variable names
- Document complex logic with comments

### Code Formatting

We use Prettier for code formatting. Run formatting with:

```bash
bun run format
```

### Linting

We use ESLint for linting. Run linting with:

```bash
bun run lint
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```
